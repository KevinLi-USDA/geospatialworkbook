<h3 id="kerrie-geil">Kerrie Geil</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/people/KerrieGeil.png" alt="Kerrie" class="align-left-profile" />
Kerrie is an ARS SCINet postdoc in the research group of Dr. Deb Peters in Las Cruces, NM. Her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are in Atmospheric Sciences and her research background is in climate modeling.
<!--
Kerrie served as a AAAS Policy Fellow at USDA ARS in Beltsville MD from 2018-2020 and has recently transitioned in July to a SCINet Postdoc position in Las Cruces, NM in the research group of Dr. Deb Peters. She received her PhD in Atmospheric Sciences from the University of Arizona in 2016 and her research background is in global and regional climate modeling and climate model performance evaluation using in-situ and satellite observations. Kerrie has expertise in global-, continental-, and regional- scale climate dynamics including teleconnections/climate oscillations (ENSO, PDO, etc.), land-atmosphere-ocean interactions, and the North American Monsoon system. She has also worked on national- and local- scale extreme temperature projects. One of the projects Kerrie hopes to accomplish during her time as a postdoc at ARS is a climate model evaluation tool to make the process of model ensemble selection (e.g. which downscaled models should be excluded from your analyses due to the garbage in garbage out principle) simpler and quicker for research scientists.--></p>

Laura E. Boucheron received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, in 2001 and 2003, respectively, and the Ph.D. degree in electrical and computer engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2008. She has intern and graduate research experience at both Sandia National Laboratories and Los Alamos National Laboratory and postdoctoral and research faculty experience in the Klipsch School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New Mexico State University. She is currently an Associate Professor in the Klipsch School. Her teaching interests include signals &amp; systems, digital signal processing, digital image processing, and pattern recognition and machine learning. Her research interests include image analysis, feature extraction, pattern recognition and machine learning, temporal image analysis, interdisciplinary research, solar image analysis, and biomedical image analysis.</p>

<h3 id="suzy-stillman">Suzy Stillman</h3>

<p><img src="/assets/images/people/SuzyStillman.png" alt="Suzy" class="align-left-profile" />
Suzy is an ARS SCINet postdoc in the research group of Dr. Deb Peters in Las Cruces, NM. Her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees are in Hydrometeorology and her research background is in hydrologic observations and projections.</p>

<!--Suzy began working as a SCINet Postdoc in Las Cruces, NM in Dr. Deb Petersâ€™ research group in July, 2020. After receiving her PhD in hydrometeorology from the University of Arizona, she worked at the Desert Research Institute in Las Vegas, NV, where her main research focus included climate analyses for DoD and DoE. Her background is in evaluating and improving the hydrologic observing system through combining data from a variety of sources. Some of her research that excites her most includes working towards understanding the impact of atmospheric rivers on Colorado River yield and the influence of topography on precipitation in the western US. Her research interests include making the best use of the already available suite of hydrologic observational data to gain a better understanding of the future hydroclimate.-->

<h3 id="amy-hudson">Amy Hudson</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/people/AmyHudson.jpg" alt="Amy" class="align-left-profile" />
Amy began her SCINet postdoc in May 2020 working with Dr. Debra Peters in Las Cruces, NM after recently completing a PhD in Natural Resources from the University of Arizona. Her research background is in examining climate-ecosystem interactions at regional to hemispheric scales by integrating multiple data sources. Past projects have focused on how changes in the Northern Hemisphere jet stream influence surface climate conditions, with impacts on the length of the growing season and continental insect migration. By leveraging signatures of climate on annual tree growth, Amy has also worked on teams to reconstruct Hadley Cell extent and summer temperatures in the US Northern Rockies, lending historical context to recent observed climate. Amy is currently involved in ARS research projects that include 1) a cross-site synthesis of the impacts of climate on long-term ecology at dryland sites and 2) determining the influence of broadscale climate on the spatial spread of the vector-borne virus Vesicular Stomatitis.</p>

<h3 id="yanghui-kang">Yanghui Kang</h3>
<p><img src="/assets/images/people/YanghuiKang.jpg" alt="Yanghui" class="align-left-profile" />
Yanghui started her SCINet Postdoc position in May 2020 after receiving a Ph.D. degree in Geography from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. She works with Dr. Feng Gao and Dr. Martha Anderson at the Hydrology and Remote Sensing Laboratory in the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center, Beltsville, Maryland. Yanghuiâ€™s research projects have focused on the large-scale high-resolution monitoring of core agroecosystem variables (e.g., Leaf Area Index (LAI), crop yield), with the help of satellite remote sensing, machine learning, crop growth modeling, and data assimilation techniques. At ARS, Yanghui is currently developing a machine-learning-based approach to map LAI from Landsat and Sentinel-2 images over the entire globe. She is also interested in deriving crop phenological stages from satellite observations and monitoring agroecosystem dynamics through data assimilation.</p>
